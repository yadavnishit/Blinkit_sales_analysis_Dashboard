Blinkit Dashboard Project – Power BI
# 📊 Project Overview
This project involves building an interactive and insightful dashboard using Microsoft Power BI based on a dataset from Blinkit (an instant delivery platform). The dashboard provides a high-level view of key business metrics such as customer behavior, sales performance, and advertisement profit.

#🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before building the dashboard, the raw Blinkit dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:
Removed null and duplicate entries
Standardized column names and data formats
Created new calculated columns (e.g., profit from advertisement, month, quarter)
Converted necessary fields to appropriate data types for better aggregation in Power BI

# 📈 Dashboard Features
The final Power BI dashboard includes the following visual and interactive elements:
✅ KPI Cards
Total Customers
Total Orders
Total Sales
Total Impressions
Profit from Advertisements
These cards give a quick glance at essential metrics.

🎯 Filters
Users can interact with the dashboard using filters for:
Quarter
Customer Segment
Payment Method
This helps in drilling down data for more specific analysis.
